Setup request.

I am uploading three files now:
1) A sample raw report (PDF is perfect — searchable or scanned, as long as it represents the report style).
2) Output_Template.xlsx (contains formulas; do not overwrite formulas).
3) Field_Mapping_Guide.docx (mapping rules + which cells are safe to fill).

Please read all three files and confirm:
- Which fields you will extract from the PDF.
- Which exact cells/columns you will fill in the Excel template.
- Which cells/columns you will never modify because they contain formulas.
- Whether you will use embedded text extraction or OCR (and under what conditions).

After you confirm, prompt me to upload the actual raw data PDFs for processing.
