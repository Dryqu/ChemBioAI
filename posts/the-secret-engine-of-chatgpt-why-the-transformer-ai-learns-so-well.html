        <p>If you have used ChatGPT, you know it generates surprisingly coherent and helpful text. But what is the core technology driving this modern AI boom? It’s called the Transformer.</p>

        <p>The popular AI models like GPT (which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer) get their power from this specific kind of neural network. They are “Generative” because they create new text, and “Pretrained” because they have learned from a massive amount of data.</p>

        <p>At its heart, the Transformer model that powers ChatGPT is trained for one fundamental goal: taking in a piece of text and producing a prediction for what comes next in the passage. When you see ChatGPT typing out a long answer, it is repeatedly playing this game: predicting the next piece of text, sampling from the distribution, adding it to the existing passage, and then running the process again and again to generate a longer response.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Tokens and Vectors (Turning Words into Numbers)</h3>

        <p>The process begins when your input is broken into small pieces called tokens (usually parts of words or common character combinations).</p>

        <p><strong>Tokens become Vectors:</strong> Each token is associated with a vector—a long list of numbers—which mathematically encodes its meaning. These vectors are the data being processed. If you think of these vectors as coordinates in some high-dimensional space, words with similar meanings tend to land on vectors that are close to each other. For example, vectors in GPT-3 have 12,288 dimensions.</p>

        <p><strong>Soaking Up Context:</strong> Initially, these vectors are simply plucked out of a matrix (the embedding matrix) and can only encode the meaning of a single word without context from their surroundings. The primary goal of the network is to enable each vector to soak up a meaning that is much more rich and specific.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: The Power of “Attention”</h3>

        <p>The vectors then flow through the crucial component known as the attention block, which is generally considered the heart of the transformer.</p>

        <p><strong>What Attention Does:</strong> The attention block allows the words (vectors) in the passage to “talk to each other” and pass information back and forth.</p>

        <p><strong>Why it Matters:</strong> This communication updates the meaning of each word based on the context of the entire passage. The attention block is what figures out which words are relevant to updating the meanings of which other words. This enables the vector that started as the simple word “king” to eventually point in a more specific and nuanced direction that encodes context—like that it was “a king who lived in Scotland, and who had achieved his post after murdering the previous king”. The network needs this ability to incorporate context efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Why Multiple Layers?</h3>

        <p>The Transformer is built with a repeating structure, not just a single step.</p>

        <p><strong>Repeating Structure:</strong> After the attention block, the vectors pass through a different kind of operation, referred to as a multi-layer perceptron or feed-forward layer. The entire process then essentially repeats, cycling back and forth between the attention blocks and these perceptron blocks.</p>

        <p><strong>Refining Meaning:</strong> The data is progressively transformed through many distinct layers. These repeating layers allow the essential meaning of the passage to be progressively transformed and “baked into” the final vectors.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: The Brain (Weights and Matrices)</h3>

        <p>All of this sophisticated transformation is based on the model’s stored knowledge:</p>

        <p><strong>Parameters and Weights (The Knowledge):</strong> The network uses a very flexible structure with tunable parameters. These parameters are the changeable settings that the model uses to learn. In deep learning, these are almost always referred to as weights. The weights are the actual brains of the model, storing all the knowledge and patterns learned during the massive training process and determining exactly how the AI behaves. For context, GPT-3 has 175 billion of these parameters.</p>

        <p><strong>Matrices (The Engine):</strong> This massive number of weights is organized into thousands of matrices. For example, the 175 billion weights in GPT-3 are organized into just under 28,000 distinct matrices. The flow of data (vectors) through the network involves operations that look like a “giant pile of matrix multiplications“. The matrices, which are filled with the learned weights, constantly transform the incoming vectors.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Softmax (Turning Scores into Probabilities)</h3>

        <p>After the data has flowed through these deep, layered structures, the final vector is used to predict the next word.</p>

        <p><strong>Mapping to Logits:</strong> An Unembedding matrix maps the final vector into a list of about 50,000 values—one for every possible token in the vocabulary. These raw, unnormalized outputs are called logits.</p>

        <p><strong>The Softmax Function:</strong> The Softmax function is a crucial mathematical function used to turn this arbitrary list of numbers (the logits) into a valid probability distribution. This is necessary because for the values to represent the likelihood of the next word, every value must be between 0 and 1, and they must all add up to 1.</p>

        <p><strong>Softmax’s Goal:</strong> Softmax is designed so that the largest values (most likely words) end up closest to 1 in the output, while the smaller values end up very close to 0. This conversion ensures the model can accurately assign the highest probability to the most predictable next token.</p>

        <p>When you interact with ChatGPT, a temperature (T) constant can be added to the Softmax function. A low temperature means the most predictable words dominate more aggressively, ensuring a trite but sensible output. A higher temperature gives more weight to less likely words, making the output more original, but risking that the text “quickly degenerates into nonsense”.</p>
