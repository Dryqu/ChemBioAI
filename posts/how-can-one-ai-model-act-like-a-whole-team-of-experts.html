                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">How can one AI model answer questions about science, code, writing, and arts without slowing down or costing a fortune?</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Traditional large models are dense models. Every part of the model works for every question. A simple "What is 1 + 1?" and a harder "What is photolysis?" both use the whole network. This is powerful, but also slow and very expensive to run.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">To make this better, researchers created MoE: Mixture of Experts.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In an MoE model, there are many smaller experts and a small router (also called a gating network). When you ask a question, the process looks like this:</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">First, the question is turned into a vector. A vector is just a list of numbers that represents the meaning of the question in a way the model can understand.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The router reads this vector and decides which experts are most helpful. For each input, it only activates a few of them, not all.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Those selected experts process the question and produce their outputs. The model then mixes these outputs into one final answer.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">So the full model can be very large, but only a small part is active each time. This keeps quality high while making computation cheaper and faster.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Of course, MoE has problems too. During training, the router may rely too much on one "star" expert and send most questions there. Other experts do almost nothing and never get good at their jobs. This is called a load imbalance. To fix it, researchers add a load-balancing loss, which gently pushes the router to spread work more fairly across experts.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Today, many strong AI models use MoE ideas. They work less like one overworked genius and more like a well-organized team: the right expert for the right question, guided by a smart router - and all powered by vectors under the hood.</p>
