                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">AI is changing the way we live and work faster than most people can keep up. We see headlines about ChatGPT, generative AI, and automation every day—but understanding what's actually happening is not easy. One of the clearest and friendliest introductions is Andrew Ng's course, AI For Everyone. It's free on YouTube and only a few hours long.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What is AI, really?</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Andrew describes AI as computers performing tasks that normally require human intelligence—recognizing speech, identifying images, translating text, or making predictions. In his course, he focuses on machine learning: algorithms that learn from examples instead of being programmed with fixed rules. You feed them data—emails, photos, numbers—and they learn patterns that map input to output.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Since the course was first released, AI has gone further. Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT can now handle complex reasoning, writing, and creative tasks by training on massive amounts of text. They don't just classify data; they generate new content, summarize knowledge, and hold conversations.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Still, Andrew's core idea remains true: AI is about learning from data to make better decisions or predictions. The scale and sophistication have grown, but the foundation is the same.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What can AI do—and what can't it do?</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">AI is excellent at recognizing patterns, predicting outcomes, and generating information. It can summarize reports, draft code, design slides, translate languages, and even brainstorm creative ideas.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">But it's not magic. AI still doesn't truly understand meaning or intent. It can sound smart while being confidently wrong. It needs high-quality data and human guidance.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Andrew's original rule still holds: AI works best when tasks are well-defined and supported by good data. What's changed is that the definition of "well-defined" has expanded—today's AI can handle more open-ended language tasks, but it still benefits from human context and review.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How AI projects actually work inside a company</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">This is one of the most useful parts of the course. Andrew explains what really happens when a company says, "Let's use AI."</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">It always starts with a clear, specific problem—something measurable, like: "Can we reduce customer-service response time by automatically routing emails?"</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Once the goal is set, the team gathers examples of past messages and how they were handled. These become the training data. Humans label the examples ("billing," "technical issue," "refund"), and engineers train a model to predict those categories for new emails.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">After testing and improving the model, it's built into the company's workflow—maybe as a chatbot or an email triage system. From there, the model is monitored, retrained, and improved as new data arrives.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In the era of LLMs, this process looks similar but faster. Instead of training from scratch, many teams start with a pre-trained model (like Llama) and fine-tune or prompt-engineer it for their task. The pattern is the same: define a goal, use data wisely, test carefully, and keep humans in the loop.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">How AI is changing jobs and society</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Andrew ends with an optimistic view. AI won't erase all jobs—it will change them. Routine tasks will be automated, but new roles will appear: people who design prompts, review AI outputs, and combine human judgment with machine assistance.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">He also stresses responsibility. AI reflects the data it learns from, including human bias. We need transparency, fairness, and accountability in how these systems are built and used.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">In today's world, that message is even more urgent. The technology is powerful, but it's still guided—and limited—by human choices.</p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.75rem; color: var(--primary-color); margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why this course still matters</h2>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Even in 2025, AI For Everyone remains one of the best introductions to AI thinking. It doesn't teach coding; it teaches perspective—how to see opportunities, ask the right questions, and work alongside AI instead of being intimidated by it.</p>
