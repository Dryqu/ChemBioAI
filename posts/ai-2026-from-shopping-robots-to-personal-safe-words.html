      <h1></h1>
      <p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending the “Research Triangle AI 2025 Year-End Fireside Chat.” The session was hosted by the Research Triangle AI Society. The panel brought together a diverse group of leaders from both top universities and the tech industry to move past the hype and discuss what actually mattered in 2025 and what we should expect in 2026.</p>
      <p>Here are the most important insights from the discussion.</p>
      <p>1. Real-World Impact: From Farms to Software</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting parts of the talk was how AI is moving beyond the screen. For example, in precision agriculture, AI-powered tractors can now identify specific crops and spray pesticides only on weeds, which saves money and reduces chemical use. In the world of software, AI is no longer just a tool for writing code; it is now being used horizontally across the entire development process, including quality testing and security analysis.</p>
      <p>2. The Strategic Edge for Small Teams</p>
      <p>An industry expert mentioned that we are at a major turning point. Interestingly, smaller and more nimble organizations might have an advantage right now. Large “Brownfield” companies often struggle with old systems and “legacy baggage,” while “Greenfield” startups can build with AI from the ground up. Furthermore, a panelist suggested that companies should not stop hiring; instead, they should “hire into the curve” to take full advantage of the massive productivity boom AI provides.</p>
      <p>3. Moving to the “Edge”</p>
      <p>There was a heavy focus on edge computing, which means processing data right where it is created (like on your phone or in a car) rather than sending it to a distant cloud. This is critical for data privacy and reducing latency (delay). For a self-driving car, for instance, processing information locally is a matter of safety, as it cannot wait for a cloud response to make a split-second decision.</p>
      <p>4. Redefining “Agents”</p>
      <p>The group agreed that the word “agent” was likely overhyped in 2025. While many tools are called agents today, “true” agents need long-term memory and the ability to interact with the world to change their own state. Looking forward, we may move toward a “library of experts” where a central “planner” picks the best specialized AI tool for a specific task.</p>
      <p>5. Predictions for 2026</p>
      <p>The experts shared several bold predictions for the coming year:</p>
      <p>• Agentic Commerce: We may soon see “agent-to-agent” protocols that allow an AI to research and actually buy products for you on sites like eBay or Shopify.</p>
      <p>• Personal Security: As AI-generated video becomes perfect, we will need “personal keys” or “safe words” to prove our identity to friends and family.</p>
      <p>• High-Speed Markets: AI agents might begin using stablecoins or other digital currencies to handle high-frequency transactions and redefine the value of data.</p>
      <p>Final Advice: Stay Human</p>
      <p>When asked how to handle the overwhelming speed of AI, the panelists offered personal advice. One suggested taking a “digital detox” by shutting off podcasts and social media to focus on problems you can actually solve. Another reminded us that while AI can help with data, creativity and “soft skills” — the ability to connect with other people — will remain economically irreplaceable in the long term.</p>
      <p>You can think of the current state of AI like a powerful new engine. In 2025, we spent a lot of time talking about how fast the engine could go. In 2026, the focus is shifting to building the rest of the car — the steering, the brakes, and the specialized tires — so that the engine can actually take us somewhere useful and safe.</p>
