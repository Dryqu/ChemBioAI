<p>In early December 2025, I attended a webinar hosted by Microsoft leaders about the future of AI at work. As someone interested in how we develop talent and keep people happy in their roles, I wanted to share some of the key takeaways.</p>

<p>AI isn’t just about doing things faster; it’s about reimagining the entire employee experience. Here are the key takeaways on how AI can support people development and talent retention.</p>

<h3>1 From “Org Charts” to “Work Charts”</h3>
<p>One of the most interesting ideas shared was the shift from a traditional organizational chart to a “work chart”. Instead of being confined to rigid departments or job titles, AI allows teams to form around business outcomes and specific skills.</p>

<p>This creates a dynamic marketplace within a company where talent can move to where it is needed most. For employees, this means more opportunities to try new things and have “agency over their own careers,” which is a huge factor in why people choose to stay at a company.</p>

<h3>2 AI Finds Your Hidden Skills</h3>
<p>We’ve all had the experience of forgetting to update our LinkedIn or internal profiles. Microsoft shared a tool called “People Skills” in Copilot that solves this. The AI looks at work signals—like the documents you create and meetings you attend—to infer what skills you actually have.</p>

<p>It then nudges you to add these skills to your profile, making you more internally marketable. For leaders, this means they can finally see a real-time map of the talent they already have in the building.</p>

<h3>3 Becoming an “Agent Boss”</h3>
<p>The webinar introduced a new mindset: every employee is becoming an “agent boss”. While AI (agents) can execute tasks, humans must always provide the oversight.</p>

<p>To succeed here, “AI literacy” has become the number one emerging skill. But it’s not just about technical knowledge; it’s about human-centric strengths like conflict mitigation, adaptability, and innovative thinking. When employees feel they are gaining these cutting-edge skills, they are more likely to feel they are “thriving” at work.</p>

<h3>4 Removing the Friction from Daily Work</h3>
<p>A major part of talent retention is making sure employees aren’t burnt out by “busy work.” Microsoft shared how Employee Self-Service (ESS) agents are reducing friction.</p>

<p>Instead of hunting through ten different systems, an employee can ask an AI agent about parental leave policies or IT troubleshooting. By automating these routine tasks, employees can spend their time on creative and high-impact work. In fact, research shows that people who use AI at least once a week are more likely to say they are thriving.</p>

<h3>5 Learning as the New “Operating System”</h3>
<p>The most successful companies—what the leaders called “Frontier Firms”—make learning their default way of working. This means moving away from boring annual performance reviews toward continuous feedback loops.</p>

<p>They also empower “citizen developers”—regular employees who are trained to build their own simple AI agents to solve local problems. This culture of growth mindset keeps teams engaged and excited about the future.</p>

<p>The key point from the webinar was clear: don’t just automate the problems of the past; rethink what’s possible for the future. When we use AI to help people grow, they don’t just work better—they feel more connected to their company.</p>

<p>If we think of a traditional company like a library, where every book (employee) is stuck on a specific shelf based on its title. AI turns that company into a digital tablet—the information stays the same, but it can be instantly reorganized, updated, and accessed whenever and however it’s needed most.</p>
