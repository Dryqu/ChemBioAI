        <p>If you are building a company today, the rules have changed. The cost of building software is falling rapidly toward zero, and the speed of execution has become the primary competitive advantage.</p>

        <p>At the AI House Davos 2026 session, a panel of experts—including AI pioneer Andrew Ng, OpenAI’s Laura Floriano, Cerebras Systems’ Andy Hawk, and ETH AI Center’s Alex Ilic—discussed what it means to build at "unprecedented scale."</p>

        <p>Here are the five key takeaways for founders, engineers, and investors navigating this new landscape.</p>

        <h3>1. Welcome to the "Agentic" Era</h3>

        <p>Two years ago, Andrew Ng noticed a shift. AI was no longer just about generating text or images; it was about autonomous, multi-step workflows. He coined the term "Agentic AI" to describe systems that can handle complex tasks with a degree of autonomy.</p>

        <p>Today, this concept has hit the mainstream. We are moving from simple chatbots to agents that fit into complex workflows. This shift is collapsing "time to value"—projects that once took weeks now take days.</p>

        <h3>2. Don’t Just Cut Costs—Reinvent the Workflow</h3>

        <p>The biggest trap for companies today is using AI merely for efficiency.</p>

        <p>Andrew Ng shares a common mistake: A bank sees that a loan approval takes a human one hour. They use AI to do it in 10 minutes. This saves money, but it doesn't transform the business.</p>

        <p>The real opportunity is total redesign. Instead of a cheaper process, build a new product: a "10-minute loan approval" for the customer. This requires breaking the business process down like "Lego bricks," shaking the box, and rebuilding the sequence entirely.</p>

        <p>As Laura Floriano from OpenAI notes, you shouldn't just look at the cost of a nurse taking notes. You should look at the final outcome: Is the patient healthier?.</p>

        <h3>3. Speed Change What You Build</h3>

        <p>We often think speed just means getting things done faster. But Andy Hawk from Cerebras Systems argues that when computing becomes ultra-fast, it changes the nature of what you can build.</p>

        <p>Think of the internet. When we moved from dial-up to broadband, we didn't just get faster bulletin boards. We got streaming video, search engines, and social media.</p>

        <p>Similarly, when AI inference becomes 10 to 50 times faster, we unlock new industries. We move from laggy chatbots to real-time voice assistants and complex reasoning models that feel instantaneous.</p>

        <h3>4. The New Hierarchy of Talent</h3>

        <p>Who is the most productive engineer in the age of AI? Andrew Ng proposes a new hierarchy:</p>

        <p>
          1. <strong>The Expert with AI</strong>: An experienced engineer who uses AI tools effectively (Highest productivity).<br>
          2. <strong>The Graduate with AI</strong>: A fresh graduate who is fluent in AI tools.<br>
          3. <strong>The Old-School Expert</strong>: An experienced engineer who refuses to use AI tools.<br>
          4. <strong>The Old-School Grad</strong>: A graduate who doesn't know AI (Lowest productivity).
        </p>

        <p>This shift is also changing team structures. The traditional ratio of one Product Manager (PM) to eight engineers is vanishing. Today, we are seeing 1:1 ratios, or even single-person teams where the engineer has the product skills to build alone.</p>

        <p>However, technical skills aren't everything. As tools make building easier, human qualities like taste, opinion, and storytelling become the true differentiators.</p>

        <h3>5. From "Attention" to "Intention"</h3>

        <p>For the last decade, the tech industry has been obsessed with the "Attention Economy"—stealing users' time through doom-scrolling and ads.</p>

        <p>Alex Ilic from the ETH AI Center predicts a shift to the "Intention Economy." Future AI agents won't try to keep you glued to a screen; they will try to predict what you intend to do and help you solve that problem. The companies that figure out how to satisfy user intent, rather than just capturing attention, will win the next decade.</p>

        <h3>The Bottom Line: Just Build</h3>

        <p>We are witnessing a boom in ambition, particularly in Europe, which minted 51 unicorns in 2025 (22% of the global total).</p>

        <p>Because the cost of testing ideas is dropping, the logical strategy is simple: Build more. Test hypotheses faster. If you have an idea, build it and test it responsibly.</p>

        <p>As Andrew Ng concluded the session: "The rational thing is to just go and build a lot more."</p>
