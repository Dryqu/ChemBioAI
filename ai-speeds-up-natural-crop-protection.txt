AI Speeds Up Natural Crop Protection
November 25, 2025

Modern agriculture needs smart, innovative solutions that protect crops while enhancing sustainability and meeting strict regulatory standards. Micropep is answering this need with its proprietary, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven discovery engine called **Krisalix**.

Krisalix is designed to identify bioactive micropeptides that naturally protect crops. This AI platform accelerates the development of next-generation crop protection solutions. These solutions, which are inspired by nature, offer new ways to tackle pests and disease, including bioherbicide, biofungicide, and bioinsecticide uses.

## Designing Solutions in Months, Not Years

The core power of Krisalix lies in its ability to combine multiple areas of expertise—generative AI, predictive models, and high-quality experimental data in areas like biology and chemistry, along with critical agronomic knowledge.

The platform uses generative AI and machine-learning models trained on massive biological datasets. This setup allows Krisalix to generate and screen millions of potential peptide sequences *in-silico* (using the computer). By doing this, Micropep can quickly identify peptides that are effective, safe, stable, and easy to produce.

Mikael Courbot, chief technology officer for Micropep, explained that this AI-powered approach allows the company to design these bioactive molecules in months instead of years. This capability materially reduces the need for traditional screening, thereby lowering costs and bringing environmentally-friendly, tailored solutions to market faster. These precision, residue-free biosolutions protect fruits and vegetables from pests without compromising safety or quality.

## Real-World Proof and Partnerships

Micropep's first AI-designed product, the biofungicide **MPD-01**, validated the effectiveness of the Krisalix approach back in 2021. MPD-01 is a micropeptide-based solution created to control major fungal diseases, such as late blight, mildews, and Asian soybean rust.

MPD-01 is currently undergoing field trials in Europe, Latin America, and the U.S., and preparations are underway for regulatory submission. MPD-01 shows how Krisalix can generate field-ready innovations that meet both agronomic and environmental expectations.

The pipeline continues to grow, with more than 10 peptide-based candidates moving forward through the Krisalix research process, addressing both high-value and broad-acre crops.

Micropep is also making Krisalix available to others through a hybrid business model that includes collaborative research and development programs. This strategy includes a recently signed joint research agreement with Corteva Agriscience. Micropep CEO Georg Goeres stated that this agreement helps position Krisalix as a reference platform, enabling partners to co-design proprietary bioactive ingredients with speed and data-driven precision.

## Key Takeaway

Think of Krisalix like a highly specialized GPS for discovery: Instead of trying millions of possible routes (traditional screening) to find a perfect new crop protection molecule, the AI quickly maps the landscape using massive data, identifying the safest, fastest, and most effective path forward.
