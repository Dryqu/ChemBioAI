Tools & Tips
Don’t Get Left Behind in the AI Era
Nov 26, 2025
If we don’t want to fall behind in the AI era, there is one simple habit we can build:
get used to using open-source tools.

You don’t need to be a programmer.
You don’t need to read code.
You just need to know where to look and be willing to try.

One of my recommendations is GitHub.

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website where people all over the world share their projects.
Someone has an idea, they turn it into a tool, then upload the code so others can use it, often for free.

Each project has “stars.” A star is just a small sign that says, “I like this. This is useful.”

If a project has a few thousand stars, many people already tested it and thought it was good.
If it has tens of thousands of stars, it is usually very popular.
If it has over a hundred thousand, it is almost a classic.

You don’t need to remember the exact numbers.
Just keep in mind: more stars usually means more people found it helpful.

Let others do the hard work
There are millions of projects on GitHub, so of course we can’t check them one by one.

The good news is: some people already help us filter.
They create public “best of” lists and share them as GitHub projects too.
Many of these lists start with the word “Awesome” in the project name.

There are “Awesome” lists for AI, Mac apps, security tools, learning resources, design, productivity, and many other topics.
These lists are like shortcuts. Instead of searching the whole internet, you open one list and slowly look through it.

You don’t need to rush. You can save a few interesting projects and come back later.

How to search for an “Awesome” list
You don’t need any special skill to find these lists.
Here is a simple way to do it.

Open github.com in your browser. At the top, you will see a search bar. Click on it and type the word “awesome” plus the topic you care about. For example: “awesome ai”, “awesome mac”, “awesome security”, or “awesome productivity”.

Press Enter. On the results page, choose “Repositories”. This shows you the project lists. Now look for projects that have many stars and have been updated in recent months.

Click into one of them. If you like it, you can click the “Star” button to save it to your GitHub account, or just bookmark it in your browser.

Pick one tool from the list and try it this week. That is enough to get started.

It’s not only about AI
Yes, there are many AI tools on GitHub.
But there are also tools for notes, to-do lists, writing, calendars, personal knowledge, and many other everyday tasks.

You can open a project page, look at the pictures, read the short description, and ask yourself:
“Could this make my day a little easier?”

If the answer is no, close it and move on.
If the answer is yes, try it for a few days and see how it feels.

The real gap: habit, not talent
In the AI era, the real difference is often not who is smarter.
It is who is willing to try new tools.

Some people only watch videos that talk about tools.
Other people open GitHub, click a few links, press the “Star” button, and actually install something.

After a year, these two groups look very different.

You can start very small: create a GitHub account, search for one “Awesome” list that matches your life, save it, and try just one tool from it this week.

You don’t have to become a developer.
You just have to become a bit more curious, and a bit more hands-on.
