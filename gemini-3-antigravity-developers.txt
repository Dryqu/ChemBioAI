Gemini 3, Antigravity, and What It Really Means for Developers
November 25, 2025

Google just launched Gemini 3 and the new Antigravity IDE. Many people say this is the start of a new era. Some even call it a "programmer killer". The truth is more interesting. And less dramatic.

## What is special about Gemini 3?

Gemini 3 is Google's latest and most powerful AI model so far. It is built for reasoning and multimodal work. That means it can handle text, images, and even video in one flow.

On public benchmarks, it does very well:

- On MMMU-Pro, a hard multimodal reasoning test, Gemini 3 Pro scores around 81%, slightly above GPT-5.1.
- On ScreenSpot-Pro, which checks if an AI can understand screens and UI layouts, Gemini 3 Pro jumps to 72.7%, far above older models.

So yes, this is not just a small upgrade. It is a big step in visual understanding and agent behavior.

But it is still part of a tight race. OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI and others are close behind in some areas, ahead in others.

We are not in "one model wins everything" land.

## What is Antigravity?

Antigravity is Google's new agent-first development platform. You can think of it as an IDE where AI agents do most of the busy work.

You type a task in natural language. For example: "Create a simple web app that tracks expenses with charts."

Then Antigravity can:

- plan the work,
- edit files in an editor,
- run commands in a terminal,
- open a built-in browser to test the app,
- generate "artifacts" like task lists, screenshots, and recordings.

Google's own blogs say this is about agents that plan, execute, and verify tasks, not just generate code once.

## How your value as a developer will shift

Here is how I see the new balance.

### 1. Less about typing. More about shaping.

Raw coding speed matters less. The important part is how you shape the problem, and how you judge the solution.

### 2. Taste becomes a skill.

AI can create many versions of an app, UI, or API. You need the taste to say: "This version is simple, clear, and reliable. Ship this one."

### 3. Domain knowledge is your edge.

If you understand healthcare, finance, chemistry, education, or logistics, you can ask much better questions. You can tell the AI what really matters and what will break in the real world.

### 4. You become a conductor.

With Antigravity and similar tools, you are not the whole orchestra. You are the conductor. You decide the plan, watch the agents work, and step in where it really counts.

## A better question than "Will AI replace programmers?"

To me, the key question is not: "Will AI replace programmers?"

A better question is: "In a world where AI can write a lot of code, what can I do that is still rare and hard?"

If you focus only on syntax, the tools will catch you. If you focus on systems, people, and judgment, the tools will lift you.

Gemini 3 and Antigravity are strong signs of where we are going: from "AI that chats" to AI that acts.

That future will be tough for some roles. But it will also create space for a new kind of developer:

- part architect,
- part product thinker,
- part agent orchestrator.

If you grow into that role, the tools are not your enemy. They are your leverage.
