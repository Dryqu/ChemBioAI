A Lab Breakthrough: AI and Green Chemistry Streamline Drug Testing
November 25, 2025

A recent study introduced a smart analytical chemistry approach that successfully determined solifenacin succinate (SOF) and mirabegron (MIR) simultaneously. These drugs form a fixed-dose combination used to manage overactive bladder (OAB).

## The Challenge and the AI Solution

The analysis of this drug mixture faced several challenges. The spectral properties of SOF and MIR presented significant overlap. MIR exhibited a strong and extended spectral configuration between 200 nm and 400 nm, while SOF showed an indistinct peak near 220 nm.

To solve the spectral overlap, researchers integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the analytical process. AI was applied to optimize signal resolution and select the appropriate wavelength in spectrophotometry.

The methodology developed two complementary smart resolution strategies:

- A zero-window scenario: This used absorbance resolution (AR) for MIR quantification and first derivative (D1) for SOF.
- A ratio-window scenario: This involved ratio extraction (RE) for MIR, followed by absorbance variation (AV) for SOF.

The smart spectrophotometric methods quantify SOF and MIR without prior separation of the compounds. The zero-order spectra analysis showed that MIR had maxima at 249.0 nm.

## Prioritizing Sustainability in the Lab

The study incorporated the principles of Green Analytical Chemistry (GAC) and aimed for sustainable analysis. Strategic decisions were implemented to align the method with the twelve principles of GAC.

A critical choice in the method design was the selection of ethanol as the main solvent. The developed method's greenness was quantitatively assessed using the Analytical Green Star Area (AGSA) tool.

## Visualizing Complex Results

To summarize the analytical results and enhance clarity, the GLANCE framework was employed. GLANCE, which stands for Graphical Layout for Analytical Chemistry Evaluation, visualizes the method attributes across twelve key dimensions.

This tool addresses the challenge of presenting complex analytical information in a concise, structured format, aiding scientific communication.

## Key Takeaways

This research exemplifies how smart analytical chemistry—merging AI, GAC, and computational intelligence—can deliver structured, accurate, and eco-friendly alternatives for pharmaceutical quality control.
